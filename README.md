# Paul Sweeney - MS1 Project - Benched 24/7

This is my website for a fictional 24 hour gym. I created this site based on my own experiences from looking for a new gym to join.
# - Business Goal

The aim to retain current members and attract new members is for the gym to have a partnership with a sportswear brand to scout potential new models for an ever-growing sportwear brand "SportiveWear" to become the face of the gyms publicity. Both businesses benefit as they get more exposure in each others environment.
# - User Experience (UX)

## 1. First Time Visitor Goals:
* As a first time vistior I want to learn more about what makes this gym different from the many others out there, so I'm looking for incentives / promotional offers.
* I want to navigate easily throught the content.
* As a potential new gym member, I want to see testimonials / feedback from current members before I invest.
## 2.  Returning Visitor Goals:
* I would like to be able to contact the gym incase I have any further questions or concerns.
* I would like to find out about any cureent personal trainers and their contact details incase I want to book a session.
## 3. Frequent Visitor Goals: 
* I would like to check the site for any updates on the collaboration competition featured.
* I would like to see any upcoming personal appearances from Models/Fitness Influencers
* I would like to check if there are any changes to company policy and procedure regarding COVID-19 restrictions or otherwise.

# - Design
## 1. Colour Scheme
* The colour scheme for the design consist of blacks, blues and whites. I based these choices on the colour scheme featured in the home page hero image. I beleive they go very well together and give the site a professional look. 

## 2. Typography
* I chose to use the Abel Family & Open Sans Condensed fonts with the Sans-Serif font as the fallback incase of any issues. The fonts i chose seem to fit well with the flow of the page and they compliment the colour scheme very well.

## 3. Imagery
* I spent some time trying to work out not only what imagery I should use for the main focal points on the site, but the color scheme and choice of background noise. 
* I chose the images because not only do the main hero images have the same colour scheme, but the backgrounds have a distinct similarity to the gym featured on page two. 
* This seems to tie in well especially for a fictional gym, it gives a genuine impression that this gym actually exists.

# - Technologies
## 1. Coding Languages:
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
