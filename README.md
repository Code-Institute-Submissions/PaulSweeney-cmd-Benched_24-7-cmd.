# Paul Sweeney - MS1 Project - Benched 24/7

This is my website for a fictional 24 hour gym. I created this site based on my own experiences from looking for a new gym to join.
# - Business Goal

The aim to retain current members and attract new members is for the gym to have a partnership with a sportswear brand to scout potential new models for an ever-growing sportwear brand "SportiveWear" to become the face of the gyms publicity. Both businesses benefit as they get more exposure in each others environment.
# - User Experience (UX)

## 1. First Time Visitor Goals:
* As a first time vistior I want to learn more about what makes this gym different from the many others out there, so I'm looking for incentives / promotional offers.
* I want to navigate easily throught the content.
* As a potential new gym member, I want to see testimonials / feedback from current members before I invest.
## 2.  Returning Visitor Goals:
* I would like to be able to contact the gym incase I have any further questions or concerns.
* I would like to find out about any personal trainers available within the business.
* I would like to know the location of the premises in the event of joining up.
## 3. Frequent Visitor Goals: 
* I would like to check the site for any updates on the collaboration competition featured.
* I would like to see any upcoming personal appearances from Models/Fitness Influencers
* I would like to check if there are any changes to company policy and procedure regarding COVID-19 restrictions or otherwise.

# - Design
## 1. Colour Scheme
* The colour scheme for the design consist of blacks, blues and whites. I based these choices on the colour scheme featured in the home page hero image. I believe they go very well together and give the site a professional look. 

## 2. Typography
* I chose to use the Abel Family & Open Sans Condensed fonts with the Sans-Serif font as the fallback incase of any issues. The fonts i chose seem to fit well with the flow of the page and they compliment the colour scheme very well.

## 3. Imagery
* I spent some time trying to work out not only what imagery I should use for the main focal points on the site, but the color scheme and choice of background noise. 
* I chose the images because not only do the main hero images have the same colour scheme, but the backgrounds have a distinct similarity to the gym featured on page two. 
* This seems to tie in well especially for a fictional gym, it gives a genuine impression that this gym actually exists.

# - Technologies
## 1. Coding Languages:
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## 2. Libararies, Frameworks & Additional Programmes:

* [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/): The Bootstrap grid system was used for the layout as well as additional forms, responsiveness and website styling.
* [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/): I used the Microsoft Word programme to create my Rules & Regulations document which appears in a seperate window when the hyperlink is clicked.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Google Fonts was used to import the Abel Family & Open Sans Condensed font style throughout my design.
* [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/): Shutterstock was used for its array of useful media images that fit well within the design of the site.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git was used for version control and to make good use of my git pod terminal to push my code from Git to GitHub.

# - Site Testing
## 1. Code checking & validation.
* I validated all four pages of my HTML code using the [W3C HTML Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and my CSS code by using the [W3C CSS Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
## 2. User story testing and results.

###  A - First Time Visitor Goals:
* As a first time vistior I want to learn more about what makes this gym different from the many others out there, so I'm looking for incentives / promotional offers or otherwise.
* I want to navigate easily throught the content.
* As a potential new gym member, I want to see testimonials / feedback from current members before I invest.

### B - Result:
* Upon first entering the site, for a 24 hour independant gym you can see a lot of effort has gone into the design - this shows the owners attention to detail. This gives the end user a positive impression that the owners care about the business.
* The nav bar stands out due to the colour scheme which enables easy navigation, the first few scrolls brings the user to the member testimonial section which is both informative and inviting. 
* The layout of the site is spacious and simple, allowing the user to avoid being distacted by too much information.
* The membership discount promotional incentive is situated within an image which fits well within both the color scheme and design.
* The collaboration page can be easily found within the nav bar which brings the first time user to the campaign page, this instantly makes the business unique as this is not something an end user would have come across before.

### A - Returning Visitor Goals:
* I would like to be able to contact the gym incase I have any further questions or concerns.
* I would like to find out about any personal trainers available within the business.
* I would like to know the location of the premises and the owner contact details in the event of joining up.

### B - Result:
* The contact form is located within the about us page which is where I as an end user would expect the contact form to be.
* The gym has 3 personal trainers available and their short story is really informative to me as an end user as I know what their principles and intentions are for their clients, rather than just a short introduction.
* The address and contact details are found together in one section.

### A - Frequent Visitor Goals:

* I would like to check the site for any updates on the collaboration competition featured.
* I would like to see any upcoming personal appearances from Models/Fitness Influencers
* I would like to check if there are any changes to company policy and procedure regarding COVID-19 restrictions or otherwise.

### B - Result: 

* The collaboration information located on page 3 shows the updated deadline for submission at the bottom of the section.
* The page has a dedicated section for each PA (Personal Appearance) announced, I enjoyed how the section is laid out in regards to imagery and information. 
* A hyperlink is found inside the footer on each page which opens up a seperate browser window detailing the gyms policies and procedures, the colour scheme of that documentation matches the site which I found to tie in well.

## 3. Devices and Browsers.

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) & [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) were the browsers used for desktop testing. All of which showed no performance flaws or new windows opened when links were clicked. 
* I used an old iPhone 5 to test my site using [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) as well as a Samsung Galaxy A21s to test the site on a bigger screen. Both of which showed no distortion or stretched / pixelated imagery.

## 4. Third Party end user testing.

* I decided to test my site on a number of colleagues and family members which I advised to act as mutual parties for genuine feedback. Most found the site to be professional, the negative feedback I recieved was regarding the Trainer and Member images not sitting evenly between their name and paragraph text. This has since been rectified and further details are explained in the 'Bugs & Fixes' section.

## 5. Bugs & Fixes.

1. NavBar links would not stay on another color when the active psuedo-class was introduced to my CSS file. This was rectified by removing the bg-dark and bg-light inline Bootstrap classes. Bootstrap had to be overidden.
2. NavBar color of black was removed when the inline bg-dark & bg-light inline classes were removed. This was resolved by creating a new CSS .navbar class and then styled with colour choice.
3. Media images and text for the Trainer and Member testimonial sections became disloged from their positioning when viewed on a mobile device. I removed the position:absolute from the .rounded-circle class and moved the images between the name header and the paragraph class and gave them a top and bottom margin to allow better positioning when viewed on a mobile device.
4. The jumbotron text on page 1 and 2 weren't centered within the image when moz, webkit & O prefixes were removed as I had sourced the hero image code from the Whisky Drop project. I had also accidentally removed the flex display, align item and justify content properties, which were restored. This then rectified the issue.
