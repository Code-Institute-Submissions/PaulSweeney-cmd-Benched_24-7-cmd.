# Paul Sweeney - MS1 Project - Benched 24/7

This is my website for a fictional 24 hour gym. I created this site based on my own experiences from looking for a new gym to join.
# Business Goal:

The aim to retain current members and attract new members is for the gym to have a partnership with a sportswear brand to scout potential new models for an ever-growing sportwear brand "SportiveWear" to become the face of the gyms publicity. Both businesses benefit as they get more exposure in each others environment.
# User Experience (UX)

## 2.  Returning Visitor Goals:
* I would like to be able to contact the gym incase I have any further questions or concerns.
* I would like to find out about any cureent personal trainers and their contact detailsincase I want to book a session.
## 3. Frequent Visitor Goals:
